# IotaAppsDistibution

To get the current folder containing SharpCap python scripts, executables (tested on Win11) for IotaGFTapp and FitsReader, and documentation PDFs, download the zip of this repository using the <> Code button.

It will be named IotaAppsDistribution-main.zip

Unzip that to get to the IotaAppsDistribution folder that you need.
